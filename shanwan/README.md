# Shanwan PS/4 Gamepad
I bought a cheap PS/4 clone Gamepad and while the system recognized the device `evtest` did not respond to buttons. An authentic PS/4 gamepad works both wired and wirelessly via Bluetooth. The quirks solution below restarts the gamepad in "Xbox360 For Windows" mode and it responds to `evtest`. Still not a PS/4 pad but a working improvement. May try modprobe next.

    echo -n "2563:0119:i" | sudo tee /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/quirks
    echo -n "2563:0119:ig" | sudo tee /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/quirks

    <2563:0119:ig>
           
    i = USB_QUIRK_DEVICE_QUALIFIER
	    (device cannot handle device_qualifier descriptor requests);
    g = USB_QUIRK_DELAY_INIT
	    (device needs a pause during initialization,
		    after we read the device descriptor);

Both work, g is probably not required and does not work by itself
